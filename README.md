## How to Use

This tutorial will have you deploying the Try Django in minutes.

Hang on for a few more minutes to learn how it all works, so you can make the most out of Heroku.

The tutorial assumes that you have:
a free Heroku account.

Python installed locally - see the installation guides for OS X, Windows, and Linux.

Setuptools and Pip installed locally. See the Python install guides above for installation instructions.

Virtualenv installed locally. Accomplish this by running pip install virtualenv.

Postgres installed locally, if running the app locally.

## Setup

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up

## Prepare the app

In this step, you will prepare a simple application that can be deployed.

Execute the following commands to clone the sample application:

$ git clone https://github.com/arshinator/trydjango-heroku.git
$ cd trydjango-heroku

You now have a functioning git repository that contains a simple application as well as a requirements.txt file, which is used by Pythonâ€™s dependency manager, Pip.

## Deploy the app

In this step you will deploy the app to Heroku.
Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code:

$ heroku create

Creating lit-bastion-5032 in organization heroku... done, stack is cedar-14
http://lit-bastion-5032.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/lit-bastion-5032.git
Git remote heroku added
When you create an app, a git remote (called heroku) is also created and associated with your local git repository.
Heroku generates a random name (in this case lit-bastion-5032) for your app, or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name.
Now deploy your code:

$ git push heroku master

While the deployment is happening, you may see a syntax error during the install for gunicorn about invalid syntax for the line yield from self.wsgi.close(). That error can be ignored.
The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:

$ heroku ps:scale web=1

Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name. As a handy shortcut, you can open the website as follows:

$ heroku open
